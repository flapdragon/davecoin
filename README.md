This is written in Node.js 18.16.0. It has both ES6 and CommonJS because I haven't coded in Node in a while and honestly I just wanted to remember the syntax.

If you are on an older version of Node that doesn't support ES6 with the "type": "module" declaration in the package.json file then you will need to use Babel or some other 3rd party compiler or just use the CommonJS version.

All of the CommonJS files are appended with "-common.cjs". Obviously you don't need both sets of files and eventually I might move the CommonJS set into its own area or remove it altogether.
